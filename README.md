## Prerequisites
Node.js and npm: Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can install them from the official Node.js website.

#### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Download the Node.js installer:

##### Go to the Node.js download page.
##### Download the LTS version.
Install Node.js:

Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation instructions.
Verify the installation:

Open the Terminal app.
Run the following commands to verify the installations:
-bash
-Copy code
-node -v
-npm -v
##### You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

#### Step 2: Install Angular CLI
Install Angular CLI globally:

In the Terminal app, run the following command:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g @angular/cli
Verify the Angular CLI installation:

Run the following command to check the version:
bash
Copy code
ng version
#### Step 3: Create a New Angular Project
Create a new Angular project:

In the Terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/directory
Run the following command to create a new project:
bash
Copy code
ng new project-name
Follow the prompts to set up your project (e.g., choose whether to add Angular routing, select the stylesheet format).
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd project-name
#### Step 4: Run the Angular Application
Serve the application:

In the Terminal, run:
bash
Copy code
ng serve
This will compile and serve your application. The default port is 4200.
Open the application in a browser:

Open your browser and go to:

Copy code
http://localhost:4200
You should see the default Angular welcome page, indicating that your Angular application is set up
